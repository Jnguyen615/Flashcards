### Abstract 

 I built a flash card game which runs only in the terminal, with questions which are about programming.

### Installation Instructions 
- Go to https://github.com/Jnguyen615/flashCards 
- Clone down the repository into your local machine
- CD into the project directory
- In your terminal run npm install (not sure if this is needed)
- In your terminal run node index.js to get the game running! 

### Context 
I am in mod 2 out of 4 at Turing School of Software and Design. I had 4 days to complete the project and it took me about 10 hours.

### Learning Goals
- Contribute to a partially constructed application
- Make the application playable
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD 

### Technology Used
- Javascript ES6
- Chai/mocha for testing
- Github

### Wins and Challenges 
I decided to use a project board for this which helped guide me on what to do next when I would get lost or stuck. I also implemented a timer which times how long it takes to complete the game which was a big win. I have done a timer before, however I did not convert the time to minutes and second, so it took some research to be able to do this and implement it properly. The biggest challenge was writing the tests first and then getting them to pass (TDD). I did like doing it this way as it challenged me to write the function in a certain way, which in some instances took more time than expected, but I managed to get the expected output. I find test writing to be very beneficial in weeding out what you want your code to do and then worrying about how you want to do it and this project really drove that home for me.
